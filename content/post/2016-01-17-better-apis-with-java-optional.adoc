:source-highlighter: pygments

In Java codebases it is very typical to come across code similar to the following:
[source,java]
----
interface PlaneProvider {
  Plane getPlane();
}
----
The contract for `PlaneProvider.getPlane()` indicates that a `Plane` will be returned. Typically a client using this interface would use it writing something like this:

[source,java]
----
Plane plane = planeProvider.getPlane();
if (plane != null) {
  plane.fly();
}
----

Notice that if the client doesn't perform the null check and a `null` is returned by `getPlane()` we would get a `NullPointerException` at runtime when we call `plane.fly()`.

== The Groovy ?. operator

Groovy provides the `?.` operator in an attempt to provide a cleaner way to write the client code:

[source,java]
----
Plane plane = planeProvider.getPlane()
plane?.fly()
----

If `plane` is `null` the call to `fly()` will not be performed.

== Enter Java 8 Optional

Using the new `Optional<T>` type in Java 8 we could rewrite the `PlaneProvider` interface above like this:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Optional;

interface PlaneProvider {}
  Optional<Plane> getPlane();
}
----

Just by reading the signature of `PlaneProvider.getPlane()` we can immediately tell that a plane may or may not be returned. The concrete implementation of `PlaneProvider` would use `Optional.of(somePlane)` to return a value or `Optional.empty()` to indicate what was previously indicated with a `null` value:

[source,java]
----
class RyanairPlaneProvider implements PlaneProvider {
  Optional<Plane> getPlane() {
    havePlane ? Optional.of(plane) : Optional.empty();
  }
}
----

In the client we can then use `Optional.isPresent()` and `Optional.get()` to check for the presence of a value and retrieve it if we want, leading to more readable code:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Plane> plane = planeProvider.getPlane();
if (plane.isPresent())
  plane.get().fly();
----

The `Optional` class provides additional methods which support a more functional style when writing code:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Plane> plane = planeProvider.getPlane();
plane.ifPresent(() -> plane.get().fly());
//or
plane.ifPresent(Plane::fly);
----

We can also model the case where a plane cannot be provided by the `PlaneProvider` using `orElse()` and using another object `sparePlane` as fallback:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Plane> plane = planeProvider.getPlane();
plane.orElse(sparePlane).fly();
----

And in the case where we don't have any spare planes we can write:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Plane> plane = planeProvider.getPlane();
plane.orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new).fly();
----

== Not on Java 8?

If for some reason you're on a version of Java prior to Java 8 you can still use `Optional` by using the https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained#Optional[Guava] library.
