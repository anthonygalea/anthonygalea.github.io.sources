http://gatling.io[Gatling] is a great tool for load testing. It provides:

- a concise Scala DSL in order to <<describe>>
- a simple means to <<run>>
- a nice html <<report>> with all the results

== Start with the end in mind

Let's start by looking at the typical output of a Gatling load test. We have overall distribution of response time for the whole load test:

A more detailed response time distribution:

image::/images/2016-01-03-gatling-response-distribution.png[]

Response time percentiles over the duration of the test:

And number of requests per second over the duration of the test:

== Describe a Load Test

This is how we would write a simple load test which performs 50 `GET` requests against a server running at `test.com`:

[source,java]
----
class SimpleSimulation extends Simulation {
  //declare a scenario with a simple get request performed 5 times
  val scn = scenario("myScenario")
            .exec(http("myRequest").get("http://test.com/page.html"))
            .repeat(5)

  //run the scenario with 10 concurrent users
  setUp(scn.users(10))
}
----

Gatling refers to load tests as `Simulations` which have one or more `Scenarios`. In the one above we are saying we will have 10 users execute 5 requests each in parallel. We could provide a `Content-Type` header with the request and check for a `200` response code like this:

[source,java]
----
http("myRequest")
  .get("http://test.com/page.html")
  .header("Content-Type", "text/html")
  .check(status.is(200))
----

If we wanted to do a `POST` request with a JSON body and basic authentication, as well as verify something in the response:

[source,java]
----
http("myRequest")
  .post("http://test.com/someresource"))
  .body(StringBody("""{ "myContent": "myValue" }"""))
  .asJSON
  .basicAuth("username", "password")
  .check(jsonPath("$..someField").is("some value"))
----

The expression used to extract `someField` from the response is passed to `jsonPath()` and is based on http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/[Goessner's JsonPath syntax]. We use `is()` to verify the expected value is equal to `some value`. We can also do other forms of verification on the response json like:

* `not(expectedValue)`: not equal to `expectedValue`
* `in(sequence)`: to check that a value belongs to the given `sequence`
* `exists()`, `notExists()`: to check for the presence/absence of a field

For a multipart request with 2 parts and gzip compression:

[source,java]
----
http("myRequest")
  .post("http://test.com/someresource"))
  .bodyPart(StringBodyPart("""{ "myContent": "myValue" }"""))
  .bodyPart(RawFileBodyPart("file", "test.txt")
  .processRequestBody(gzipBody)
----

We can also create scenarios with multiple requests and use the result from previous requests in subsequent requests like this:

[source,java]
----
scenario("myScenario")
  .exec(http("request1")
          .post("http://test.com/resource1")
          .body(StringBody"""{ "myContent": ""}""")
          .check(jsonPath("$..myResponse.guid").saveAs("guid")))
  .exec(http("request2")
          .put("http://test.com/resource2/${guid}")
          .body(StringBody"""{ "someOtherField": ""}"""))
----
`guid` is extracted from the response of the first call using `saveAs("guid")` and used in the path to the `PUT` call.

Scenarios can also be run with a ramp up. If we wanted to run the scenario above with 1000 users with a ramp up of 20 seconds we would do:

[source,java]
----
setUp(scn.users(1000).ramp(20))
----

[[run]]
== Run a Simulation

There are a number of ways to run Gatling simulations. You can http://gatling.io/#/download[download the bundle], place your simulations under the `user-files/simulations` directory and then run `bin/gatling.sh`.

If you prefer integration with your build system there are plugins for http://gatling.io/docs/2.1.7/extensions/maven_plugin.html[Maven], https://github.com/alphagov/gradle-gatling-plugin[Gradle] and http://gatling.io/docs/2.1.7/extensions/sbt_plugin.html[SBT]. For example, for Maven we just add the dependencies in the `pom.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.gatling.highcharts</groupId>
    <artifactId>gatling-charts-highcharts</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
   <plugins>
     <plugin>
       <groupId>io.gatling</groupId>
       <artifactId>gatling-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
----

Place simulations under `src/test/scala/com/company/service` and then in the terminal:
[source,bash]
----
mvn gatling:execute -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.company.service.YourSimulation
